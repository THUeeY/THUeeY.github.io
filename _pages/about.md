I am excited to soon join **Duke** University as a PhD student in 
the MEMS program in Sping 2025, 
under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaoyue Ni](https://pratt.duke.edu/people/xiaoyue-ni).

In 2024, I received my master's degree in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University, where I was advised by [Prof. Ji Wu](https://www.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1064/1273.htm). In 2021, I completed my undergraduate studies in the same department at Tsinghua University.

My research interests include computer vision, 
machine learning, and medical intelligence.
